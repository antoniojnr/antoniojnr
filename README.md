## 👨🏽‍💻 About Me

Hello, my name is Antonio. I'm a professor at the Federal Institute of Paraíba, in Brazil, where I teach courses in Computer Science. Our institution is part of the federal public education system, focused on higher and technical education.

Although I am not currently working directly in the software industry, I continuously develop practical solutions to streamline my academic work and improve personal productivity. I believe in building simple, purposeful tools that solve real problems in teaching and learning.

Further below, you'll find repositories containing some of the solutions I've developed.

## 📂 Featured Projects

Below is a selection of projects showcasing tools and solutions I've developed to support my teaching activities, streamline academic workflows, or address practical challenges through programming.  
These projects reflect my focus on automation, software quality, educational innovation, and technical problem-solving.

- [**Inquognito**](https://inquognito.vercel.app) is a platform that ensures all students the freedom to ask questions without fear of judgment. One of the main reasons many avoid speaking up in class is the embarrassment of asking a question that might seem obvious or “silly.”  
  It is a full-stack web application built with **Next.js App Router**, using **React Server Components** and **Server Actions** to efficiently integrate frontend and backend logic.  
  Data persistence is managed via **Supabase**, a Backend-as-a-Service platform with PostgreSQL and built-in authentication.  
  **(2024 – ongoing)**

- [**Autocorretor**](https://github.com/antoniojnr/autocorretor) is a tool developed to automate the evaluation of Java projects submitted by students, with a focus on object-oriented programming education.  
  It reduces the manual effort involved in verifying structure, compiling code (via **Gradle**), running **JUnit** tests, and applying objective grading criteria.  
  **(2024 – ongoing)**

- [**Codeshare**](https://github.com/antoniojnr/codeshare) is a Visual Studio Code extension that mirrors your code in real time to an HTML page with syntax highlighting.  
  It’s ideal for live coding over a local network, teaching, and pair programming.  
  **(2025)**
